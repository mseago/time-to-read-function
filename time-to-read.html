			<h1>Groundhog Day (film)</h1>
			<h2>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h2>
			<p id="min-to-read"> </p>
			<p>Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy-drama film directed by Harold
  			Ramis, starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott. It was written
  			by Ramis and Danny Rubin, based on a story by Rubin.</p>

				<p>Murray plays Phil Connors, an arrogant Pittsburgh TV weatherman who, during an
					assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania,
					finds himself in a time loop, repeating the same day again and again. After
					indulging in hedonism and committing suicide numerous times, he begins to
					re-examine his life and priorities.</p>

					<p>In 2006, the film was added to the United States National Film Registry as
  				being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".[3]
  			A stage musical version of the film is scheduled to premiere in 2016.</p>


				<h3>Plot[edited]</h3>
				<p>On February 1, misanthropic TV meteorologist Phil Connors (Bill Murray),
					news producer Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell), and cameraman Larry (Chris
					Elliott) of the fictional Pittsburgh television station WPBH-TV 9, travel to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities. The following morning, Phil, who does not like the assignment or Punxsutawney, grudgingly gives his report on the festivities. He then gets his team on the road back to Pittsburgh, but a blizzard shuts down all travel. The team is forced to return to Punxsutawney and stay another night.</p>


					<h3>Number of days Phil spends in Punxsutawney[edited]</h3>
					<p>Estimates regarding how long Phil is trapped in the time loop vary widely. Director Ramis stated in the DVD commentary that he believed 10 years pass. However, in an e-mail response sent to Heeb magazine, Ramis wrote, "I think the 10-year estimate is too short. It takes at least 10 years to get good at anything, and allotting for the down time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years."[4]</p>

					<p>According to actor Stephen Tobolowsky, Ramis told him that the entire progress of Groundhog Day covered 10,000 years. "I always thought that there were nine days represented [in the film], and Danny Rubin, the writer, said that he felt something like 23 days were represented in the movie, [but they lasted] over 10,000 years."[5]</p>

					<p>In 2014, the website WhatCulture estimated that Phil spent 12,395 days—just under 34 years—in the time loop.[6]</p>
